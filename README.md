Guest Api (module for Omeka S)
==============================

> __New versions of this module and support for Omeka S version 3.0 and above
> are available on [GitLab], which seems to respect users and privacy better
> than the previous repository.__

[Guest Api] is a module for [Omeka S] that allows to manage the actions of the
guest or any other user, provided by the module [Guest], by the module [Guest Role]
or any other module, by the api. This api allows in particular to register, to
update the password, or to update its own profile and settings. So it does not
replace the standard api (/api/users/#id), but adds some checks and features.


Installation
------------

Install module [Guest] first.

Uncompress files in the module directory and rename module folder `GuestApi`.
Then install it like any other Omeka module and follow the config instructions.

See general end user documentation for [Installing a module].


Usage
-----

First, specify the roles that can login by api in the config form of the module.
Note that to allow any roles to login, in particular global admins, increase the
access points to check for security.

The path `/api/users/me` is used for the user that is currently authenticated
through the credentials arguments. This is a shortcut to `/api/users/{id}` for
common actions, in particular to get the current user own data.

Other http methods are available to update the profile with the same path. For
example to update (http method `PATCH`/`POST`):
- email: /api/users/me?email=elisabeth.ii@example.com
- name: /api/users/me?name=elisabeth_ii
- password: /api/users/me?password=xxx&new_password=yyy

In all other cases, you should use the standard api (`/api/users/#id`).

Four specific paths are added:

- /api/login
  The user can log in with a post to `/api/login` with data `{"email":"elisabeth.ii@example.com","password"=""***"}`.
  In return, a session token will be returned. All other actions can be done
  with them: `/api/users/me?key_identity=xxx&key_credential=yyy`.

  If the option to create a local session cookie is set, the user will be
  authenticated locally too, so it allows to log in from a third party webservice,
  for example if a user logs in inside a Drupal site, he can log in the Omeka
  site simultaneously. This third party login should be done via an ajax call
  because the session cookie should be set in the browser, not in the server, so
  you can’t simply call the endpoint from the third party server. In you third
  party ajax, the header `Origin` should be filled in the request; this is
  generally the case with common js libraries.

  When a local session cookie is wanted, it is recommended to add a list of
  sites that have the right to log in the config for security reasons.

- /api/logout

- /api/session-token
  A session token can be created for api access. It is reset each time the user
  login or logout. The api keys have no limited life in Omeka.

- /api/register
  A visitor can register too, if allowed in the config. Register requires an
  email. Other params are optional: `username`, `password`, and `site` (id or
  slug, that may be required via the config).

**Warning**: The paths above may be changed in a future version to be more restful.


TODO
----

- [ ] Normalize all api routes and json for rest api (register, login, logout, session-token).


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.


Troubleshooting
---------------

See online issues on the [module issues] page.
